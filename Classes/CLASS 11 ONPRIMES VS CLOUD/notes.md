### 🌐 On-Premise vs Cloud– Study Notes

---

#### 📍 **Definition**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Infrastructure is hosted locally within the organization.
  - Organization is responsible for maintenance, security, and upgrades.

- **Cloud (Azure):**
  - Services hosted on Microsoft Azure’s data centers.
  - Pay-as-you-go model with scalability and managed services.

---

#### ⚙️ **Infrastructure Management**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Full control over hardware and software.
  - Requires in-house IT team for setup and maintenance.

- **Azure Cloud:**
  - Microsoft manages infrastructure.
  - Users focus on app/data/services, not hardware.

---

#### 💸 **Cost**

- **On-Premise:**
  - High upfront capital expenditure (CapEx).
  - Ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs.

- **Azure:**
  - Operational expenditure (OpEx) model — pay only for what you use.
  - No hardware investments needed.

---

#### 📈 **Scalability**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Limited by physical infrastructure.
  - Scaling requires new hardware purchases.

- **Azure:**
  - Auto-scaling available.
  - Virtually unlimited resources on-demand.

---

#### 🔐 **Security & Compliance**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Complete control of security, but high responsibility.
  - Easier to meet certain compliance standards locally.

- **Azure:**
  - Built-in security tools (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Cloud).
  - Compliance with global standards (ISO, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).

---

#### 🌎 **Accessibility**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Limited to internal network unless configured otherwise.

- **Azure:**
  - Accessible globally via internet.
  - Supports hybrid and remote work environments.

---

#### 🔄 **Disaster Recovery & Backup**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Needs custom setup for DR/backup.
  - Risk of data loss if not properly managed.

- **Azure:**
  - Azure Backup & Azure Site Recovery for integrated solutions.
  - High availability and built-in redundancy.

---

#### ⚡ **Deployment Speed**

- **On-Premise:**
  - Slower — hardware procurement, setup, software config.

- **Azure:**
  - Fast provisioning — VMs, services can be spun up in minutes.

---

#### 🧩 **Examples of Azure Services**

- **IaaS:** Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Load Balancer
- **PaaS:** Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database
- **SaaS:** Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365
- **Hybrid:** Azure Stack, Azure Arc
