# 3-Tier Architecture

## Introduction

3-Tier Architecture is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three layers, each with its own functionality. This design enhances scalability, maintainability, and security by logically dividing an application into independent layers.

## Layers of 3-Tier Architecture

### 1. **Presentation Layer (Client Layer)**

- The user interface (UI) of the application.
- Handles user interactions and displays data.
- Examples: Web browsers, mobile applications, front-end frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js).

### 2. **Application Layer (Business Logic Layer)**

- Processes business logic, computations, and rules.
- Acts as an intermediary between the presentation and database layers.
- Examples: API services, web servers, backend frameworks (Node.js, Django, .NET, Spring Boot).

### 3. **Database Layer (Data Layer)**

- Manages data storage and retrieval.
- Ensures data integrity and security.
- Examples: SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra).

## Example: E-Commerce Application

Imagine an online shopping website that follows a 3-Tier Architecture:

### 1. **Presentation Layer**

- Users interact with the website using a browser.
- The front-end (React, Angular) displays products and handles user inputs.

### 2. **Application Layer**

- Business logic processes user requests.
- When a user adds a product to the cart, the backend (Node.js, Django) validates stock availability and calculates the total price.

### 3. **Database Layer**

- Stores user information, product details, and order history.
- The database (MySQL, MongoDB) fetches product details when requested by the application layer.

## Advantages of 3-Tier Architecture

- **Scalability:** Each layer can be scaled independently.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to modify or update individual layers.
- **Security:** Sensitive data is protected by isolating the database layer.
- **Flexibility:** Components can be replaced without affecting the entire system.

## Conclusion

3-Tier Architecture is widely used in modern applications to improve efficiency and organization. It separates concerns, making applications more manageable, scalable, and secure.

Application architecture is typically divided into different **tier architectures** based on how components are structured and separated. The main types of tier architecture are:  

1. **Single-Tier Architecture (Monolithic Architecture)**  
   - All components (UI, business logic, and database) are within a single application.  
   - Example: A standalone desktop application.  

2. **Two-Tier Architecture (Client-Server Architecture)**  
   - The application is divided into two layers:  
     - **Client Layer** (User Interface and Business Logic)  
     - **Server Layer** (Database)  
   - Example: A database-driven desktop application where the frontend directly communicates with a database.  

3. **Three-Tier Architecture**  
   - The application is divided into three layers:  
     - **Presentation Layer** (UI)  
     - **Business Logic Layer** (Processing)  
     - **Data Layer** (Database)  
   - Example: A web application with a frontend, a backend (API or middleware), and a database.  

4. **N-Tier Architecture (Multi-Tier Architecture)**  
   - Extends the three-tier architecture by adding more layers such as:  
     - **Application Layer** (Separating APIs)  
     - **Service Layer** (Microservices)  
     - **Caching Layer** (Redis, Memcached)  
   - Example: Cloud-native applications, microservices, and large enterprise applications.  

Each tier architecture is chosen based on scalability, performance, and security requirements. Let me know if you need further details! ðŸš€
