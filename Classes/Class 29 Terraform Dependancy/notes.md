## 🔍 What is Dependency Management in Terraform?

Terraform automatically figures out the **correct order** to create resources by analyzing **resource references**.

There are two types of dependencies:

| Type        | Description                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Implicit  | Created automatically when a resource references another.                 |
| ⚠️ Explicit | Manually declared using `depends_on` when no direct reference is present. |

## ☁️ AzureRM: Practical Example

### 🔨 Goal:

Provision:

1. A **Resource Group**
2. A **Storage Account** that **must** be created **after** the Resource Group

---

## ✅ Implicit Dependency Example

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestoracct"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name   # <- Implicit dependency
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

🧠 **Why this works:**
The `azurerm_storage_account` resource depends on values from the resource group, so Terraform understands the creation order automatically.

---

## ⚙️ Explicit Dependency Example (Using `depends_on`)

Use `depends_on` when:

* There's **no direct reference** between resources
* You still want to **enforce creation order**

```hcl
resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "example" {
  name                = "example-law"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "PerGB2018"
  retention_in_days   = 30

  depends_on = [azurerm_resource_group.example]  # <- Explicit dependency
}
```

🧠 **Why use this:**
Even if the workspace doesn't use properties from the resource group directly (in some cases), you can force order.

---

## 📦 Bonus: Dependency in Modules

When using modules:

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./network"
}

module "vm" {
  source = "./vm"

  depends_on = [module.network]  # Explicit dependency between modules
}
```

---

## 🏁 Best Practices

✅ Use **implicit** dependencies whenever possible
⚠️ Use **`depends_on`** only when needed (e.g., cross-module or indirect dependencies)
📦 For **modules**, `depends_on` is often necessary for clean orchestration
🧹 Keep Terraform graphs simple by avoiding overuse of `depends_on`
